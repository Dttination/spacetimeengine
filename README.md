# spacetime-toolkit
A python toolkit for Einstein's field equations.

Project Goals
=============

1.) Computing any of the following for a given metric and coordinate set:
    Connection Coefficients
    Ricci tensor, 
    Ricci scalar, 
    Einstien tensor,
    Stress Tensor

2.) Computing all geodesics for a given metric, coordinate set and initial conditions

3.) Provide visualization tools which can be configured to match any metric.
