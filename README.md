# spacetime-toolkit-Unfinished Expect functionality around January
A python toolkit for exploring the Einstein's field equations.

Project Goals
=============

1.) For a given metric tensor and coordinate set, provide functions which compute all of the following quantities:
    Connection Coefficients
    Ricci tensor, 
    Ricci scalar, 
    Einstien tensor,
    Stress Tensor,
    Geodesic equations,
    Plotting velocities, orbits, geodesic paths.
    
2.) Print the previous terms in a clean and intuitive predefined format which bypasses the limitations imposed by sympy.

3.) Computing all geodesics equations for a given metric, coordinate set, parameterization type and initial conditions.

4.) Plotting any or all acceleration vectors, velocity vectors, position vectors for any or all spacelike,timelike and null geodesics.

5.) Provide visualization tools which can be configured to match any metric.

6.) Provide a configuration file which allows the user to customize the output profile for a given metric and coordinate set.

Project Purpose
===============
 1.) To provide code which demonstrates general relativity and can be studied.
 2.) To provide code which can be utalized by researchers or engineers.
 3.) To provide concrete numeric calculations directly from the symbolic form of the einstien field equations.
 4.) Provide context by integrating latex representations of the functions.
