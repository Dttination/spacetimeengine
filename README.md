# spacetime-toolkit
A python toolkit for Einstein's field equations.

Project Goals
=============

1.) Computing any of the following quantities for a given metric tensor and coordinate set:
    Connection Coefficients
    Ricci tensor, 
    Ricci scalar, 
    Einstien tensor,
    Stress Tensor
    
2.) Print the previous terms in a clean and intuitive predefined format.

3.) Computing all geodesics equations for a given metric, coordinate set and initial conditions.

4.) Plotting any acceleration vectors, velocity vectors, position vectors for any or all spacelike,timelike and null geodesics.

5.) Provide visualization tools which can be configured to match any metric.
